# ally.style.focusSource

Differentiate the causes of focus change for when different visual styles need to applied.


## Description

The utility identifies `pointer` (mouse, touch), `key` (keyboard) and `script` as sources for an element being focused. The information is made available to CSS via `<html data-focus-source="key">`. The classes `.focus-source-key`, `.focus-source-pointer`, `.focus-source-script` are made available on `<html>` when the respective focus source occurs for the first time. When the utility is initialized, the focus source is `<html data-focus-source="initial">`.

This module allows the document to style `:focus` as follows:

```css
body :focus {
  /* default styling in case JS broke */
  background: yellow;
}
html[data-focus-source="initial"] > body :focus {
  /* styling for when focus was not changed yet */
  background: green;
}
html[data-focus-source="pointer"] > body :focus {
  /* styling for when focus was given by pointer (mouse, touch) */
  background: red;
}
html[data-focus-source="key"] > body :focus {
  /* styling for when focus was given by keyboard */
  background: blue;
}
html[data-focus-source="script"] > body :focus {
  /* styling for when focus was given by neither pointer nor keyboard */
  background: orange;
}

html.focus-source-key > body :focus {
  /* styling for when focus was changed at least once using the keyboard */
  background: magenta;
}
```

The focus changes are also observed within the ShadowDOM, allowing the document styles to descend into the dark:

```css
html[data-focus-source="pointer"] >>> :focus {
  /* styling for when focus was given by pointer (mouse, touch) */
  background: red;
}

/* older shadow-piercing-combinator notation */
html[data-focus-source="pointer"] /deep/ :focus {
  /* styling for when focus was given by pointer (mouse, touch) */
  background: red;
}
```


## Usage

```js
var handle = ally.style.focusSource();

handle.disengage();

// get current focus source
handle.current(); // "key", "pointer", "script"

// test if a focus source has occurred at least once before
handle.used('key'); // true, false

// make all focus events use a specific source type
// regardless of the identified interaction type
handle.lock('pointer');
// revert locking into a specific source type
handle.unlock();
```

The identified focus source is retained when shifting focus to another element:

```js
var handle = ally.style.focusSource();

element.addEventListener('click', function() {
  otherElement.focus();
});
```

Use `.lock()` to retain the identified focus source when shifting focus asynchronously:

```js
var handle = ally.style.focusSource();

element.addEventListener('click', function() {
  handle.lock(handle.current());
  setTimeout(function() {
    otherElement.focus();
    handle.unlock();
  });
});
```


### Arguments


### Returns

A [`<global-service>`](../concepts.md#global-service) interface, providing the `handle.disengage()` method to stop the service.

### Throws


## Service handle

The `handle` is returned when engaging the service. As the [`<global-service>`](../concepts.md#global-service) interface describes, the `handle.disengage()` method is provided to stop the service. Additionally the following methods are made available:

### handle.current()

The `handle.current()` method does not accept any arguments and returns one of the following strings `"key"`, `"pointer"`, `"script"`, depending on the current interaction type.

### handle.used(`<string>`)

The `handle.used()` method accepts one string argument and returns `true` if that interaction type has ever been used before.

### handle.lock(`<string>`)

The `handle.lock()` method accepts one string argument and sets that as the interaction type for all subsequent `handle.current()` invocations.

### handle.unlock()

The `handle.unlock()` method releases the focus-source lock.


## Examples

* **EXAMPLE:** [`ally.style.focusSource` Example](./focus-source.example.html)


## Changes

* In `v1.3.0` the method `handle.unlock()` was added to supersede `handle.lock(false)`, which is still available, but removed from documentation.
